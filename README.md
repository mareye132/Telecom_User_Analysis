The project is particularly useful for telecommunications companies seeking data-driven approaches to reduce churn and personalize customer experiences.

This repository includes Python scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models for churn prediction, and visualizations that highlight key findings 🔍. Core libraries used include Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, allowing for in-depth analysis and visualization of customer trends. Additionally, a Streamlit dashboard enables interactive exploration of the analysis results, making it easy for users to engage with the data 💻. Through Telecom User Analysis, companies can make informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction and business outcome.
